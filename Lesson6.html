    <h2>HTML Attributes:</h2>
    <p>
        째 All HTML elements can have attributes<br>
        째 Attributes provide additional information about elements<br>
        째 Attributes are always specified in the start tag<br>
        째 Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"<br>
    </p>
    <!--

    -- > The href Attribute:

    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Example:

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

    -- > The src Attribute:

    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path
    to the image to be displayed. Example:

    <img src="img_girl.jpg">

    ``` OBS.:
    There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

    1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
    Example: src="https://github.com/CarlosViniMSouza/CarlosViniMSouza/blob/main/images/Others/techs_2020.png".

    2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the
    domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
    Example: src="img_girl.jpg".

    If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
    Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
    ```

    -- > The width and height Attributes:

    The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies
    the width and height of the image (in pixels).

    Example: <img src="techs_2020.png" width="500" height="600">

    -- > The alt Attribute

    The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some
    reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute,
    or if the user uses a screen reader.

    Example: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

    -- > The style Attribute

    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

    Example: <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
    --->
    <div>
        <p style=" font-family: 'Fira Code' " title="A text about recommendations">
            --> We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes<br><br>

            &nbsp; The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.<br>
            The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.<br>
            However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.<br>
            At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.<br>

            <br>--> We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values<br><br>

            &nbsp; The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.<br>
            However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.
